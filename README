A volume is created as a volume of space with a given mass and uniform density.
A volume is filled* with user-defined diameter particles* that fill up a volume starting from the center* of a volume.

*FILLED: The process of filling a volume with particles* starts with a single particle at the center*.
Each particle fills up the volume in a square grid pattern where incrementation on the horizontal or vertical axis is uniform.
The boudary of each particle should never exit the boundary of the volume that of which is being filled.

*PARTICLES: a point mass with mass equal to the total mass of the occupied volume divided by the number of particles within that volume.

*CENTER: centroid calculated by arithmetic mean of all vertices where centroid (x, y) = ((x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + ... + x_k) / k, (y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + ... + y_k) / k).
